# recommended-natural

## üìñ Details

Configuration for the `eslint-plugin-perfectionist` plugin, which provides all plugin rules with predefined options: natural sorting in ascending order.

What is the difference between natural sorting and alphabetical sorting? Natural sort compares strings containing a mixture of letters and numbers, just as a human would do when sorting. For example: `item-1`, `item-2`, `item-10`.

This configuration will allow you to navigate through your code faster because all the data that can be safely sorted will be in order.
