# Introduction

ESLint plugin that sets rules to format your code and make it consistent.

This plugin defines rules for sorting various data, such as objects, imports, TypeScript types, enums, JSX props, etc.

---

Sorting imports and properties in software development offers numerous benefits:

- **Readability**: Finding declarations in a sorted, large list is a little faster. Remember that you read the code much more often than you write it.

- **Maintainability**: Sorting imports and properties is considered a good practice in software development, contributing to code quality and consistency across the codebase.

- **Code Review and Collaboration**: If you set rules that say you can only do things one way, then no one will have to spend time thinking about how to do it.

- **Code Uniformity**: When all code looks exactly the same, it is very hard to see who wrote it, which makes achieving the lofty goal of _collective code ownership_ easier.

- **Aesthetics**: This not only provides functional benefits, but also gives the code an aesthetic appeal, visually pleasing and harmonious structure.

The plugin supports:
