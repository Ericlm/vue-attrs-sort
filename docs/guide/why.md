# Why

Sorting imports and properties in software development offers numerous benefits:

- **Readability**: Finding declarations in a sorted, large list is a little faster. Remember that you read the code much more often than you write it.

- **Maintainability**: Sorting imports and properties is considered a good practice in software development, contributing to code quality and consistency across the codebase.

- **Code Review and Collaboration**: If you set rules that say you can only do things one way, then no one will have to spend time thinking about how to do it.

- **Code Uniformity**: When all code looks exactly the same, it is very hard to see who wrote it, which makes achieving the lofty goal of _collective code ownership_ easier.

- **Aesthetics**: This not only provides functional benefits, but also gives the code an aesthetic appeal, visually pleasing and harmonious structure. Take your code to the beauty salon!
